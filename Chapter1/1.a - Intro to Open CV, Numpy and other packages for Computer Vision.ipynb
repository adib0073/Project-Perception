    "Python is not the only language to implement computer vision in practice. But the very fact that, it is one of the easiest languages to learn, and develop an end to end solution using the vast and efficient python packages, platform agnostic nature and an extremely large and proactive community, makes Python my first choice for implementing computer vision in practice.\n",

    "In some platforms, installing Python, setting up environment variables and individually installing the packages can be extremely difficult and cumbersome. This is the only reason, I am going with the [Anaconda distribution of Python](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) for many years now. The anaconda version of the python comes along with most of the popular python packages like numpy, pandas etc. and most pre-configured and easy to install in any platform, and hence it saves a lot of time in getting the infratsructure sorted. Also, just a note, I know since the entire Python ecosystem is growing massively every single day, is it possible that you might run into compatibility issues due to version mismatch of the packages. I will try my best, to mention the package versions that I will be using and my humble apology if I have missed in doing so. In such cases, please do drop me a note and I will try my best to rectify the mistakes at the earliest.\n",

So, for executing the code or projects mentioned in this book, I would strongly recommend all the readers to use Jupyter Notebooks. The Python version that I am using is **Python 3.7**.\n",

    "Coming to the most important package that we will be using for Computer Vision related experiments is [Open-CV](https://opencv.org/) which is also one of the most popular packages to be used across the world for computer vision related work.\n",

    "So, let's take a look of how to install open-cv. Also just a note, I download most of my python packages using the popular *pip* installer and I prefer searching my modules from https://pypi.org/ . I will be using Jupyter notebooks to install my Python packages. So, once the notebook is running in your local browser, open the notebook and execute the following command:\n",
